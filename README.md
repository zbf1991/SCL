## Introduction
Code for 'Self-Guided and Cross-Guided Learning for Few-shot segmentation. (CVPR' 2021)'

We evaluated our approach using two baselines:

CANet [1] (project is [here](https://github.com/icoz69/CaNet)) and PFENet [2] (project is [here](https://github.com/dvlab-research/PFENet)).

We followed the same setting with them.

You can follow the preparations of these two baselines, or you can find the running details in our documents.
